Commands: 
1.1. Save the list of installed shells:
cat /etc/shells

cat /etc/shells > ~/sandbox/shells.txt
That file is /etc/shells. The line above copies it into your sandbox.

2.1. Make zsh the shell you get every time you log in:
sudo chsh -s "$(which zsh)" $USER

Put your settings in ~/.zshrc. Covers the alias, the theme, the team aliases, and the git plugin:

cat > ~/.zshrc << 'EOF'
alias ll='ls -lah'
alias gs='git status'
alias k='kubectl get pods'
alias dc='docker compose'
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
plugins=(git)
EOF

ll is a shortcut for ls -lah. gs, k, and dc are the team shortcuts. ZSH_THEME picks a theme. plugins=(git) turns on the git plugin.
